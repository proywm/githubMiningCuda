Our implementation is faster than the state-of-the-art implementations. Existing the state-of-the-art library also decompresses the whole embedding tables on the fly therefore they do not provide memory reduction during runtime of the training. Our library decompresses only the requested rows therefore can provide 10,000 times memory footprint reduction per embedding table. The library also includes a software cache to store a portion of the entries in the table in decompressed format for faster lookup and process.",188,28,2022-07-20T21:30:26Z,https://github.com/facebookresearch/FBTT-Embedding
